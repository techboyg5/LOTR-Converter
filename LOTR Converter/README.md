# LOTR Converter

This is an iOS app written in Swift that allows you to convert numbers between the following different currencies:

* Copper Penny
* Silver Penny
* Silver Piece
* Gold Penny
* Gold Piece
* Bronze Piece

I developed this app as part of [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/). I highly recommend getting it if you're interested in learning iOS app development!
